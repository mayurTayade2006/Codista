Full MERN Stack: Real MongoDB database, Express API, React Frontend, and Node.js runtime.
Hybrid Resilience: The unique "Offline/Mock Mode" ensures that even if your database goes down or isn't running, the entire app (Authentication, Course Creation, Progress Tracking, Q&A) switches to localStorage automatically so the UI never breaks.
Interactive Learning: Students can watch videos, take quizzes, and now Ask Questions directly to instructors in a threaded Q&A section.
Progress Tracking: Every video watched and quiz taken is recorded, giving students a visual dashboard of their learning journey.
Polished UI: Dark mode, responsive design, and high-quality dynamic thumbnails make it feel like a professional product.
